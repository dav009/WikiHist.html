A tactical unit of the Toronto Police Service to deal with high risk situations like gun calls, hostage taking, barricaded persons, emotionally disturbed persons, high risk arrest and protection details. The unit was created in [[1965]].

==Organization==
The unit's current commander is Staff Inspector James Ramer. Emergency Task Force currently comprises of 70 officers from all units and are trained on tactical training. There are nine officers to each tactical team. Each tactical team has a team leader, sniper, negotiator / emotionally disturbed persons expert. All team members are also considered assaulters, who are trained to go into a premise and rescue any hostage(s) and arrest or neutralize any suspect(s)

The unit is located in [[Don Mills, Ontario]] at 35,000 square foot building built in [[1989]]:

* meeting rooms
* two shooting ranges
* rappelling tower
* exercise room 
* large garage to house the units specialized vehicles

The Emergency Task Force (E.T.F) is the unit which three of the police services specialized units fall into. The special weapons teams (tactical), explosive disposal unit (E.D.U), and the emergency response unit (E.R.U) which provides specialized equipment to the service (high powered lights, crane, mobile command post).

The team does training not only at their station in Don Mills, but also at C.F.B Borden, a military base about 45 minutes north of the city. The unit also trains with members of the Canadian Military, in particular it's special forces / anti-terrorism unit Joint Task Force Two (J.T.F-2) which works out of the Dwyer Hill Training Facility outside of Ottawa.

The E.T.F. also has a close working relationship with other police tactical teams in the Greater Toronto Area, such as the York Regional Police Emergency Response Unit (E.R.U), the Durham Regional Police Tactical Support Unit (T.S.U) and the Peel Regional Police Tactical and Rescue Unit (T.R.U). 

==Equipment==
The E.T.F utilizes Glock semi-automatic pistols as their sidearm. Officers also have the the Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 9mm submachine gun, Remington 700 sniper rifle, (which fires a 7.62mm round), Remington 870 shotgun, and the Diemaco C8, which is the Canadian version of the Colt M4 carbine, firing a .223 caliber round. Less than lethal options are also at the disposal of team members such as the M18 and X26 Tasers, Pepper Spray (OC Spray) and Tear Gas (CS Gas) and Rubber Bullets or BeanBags rounds. 

The main vehicles used by the team include Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors and G.M.C Surburbans. The E.T.F also has an armoured car in their garage which can be used to rescue injured civlians or officers.

Some police tactical teams have a police helicopter at their disposal. The helicopter can be used as a method of inserting team members, gathering valuable intelligence, acting as a position for a sniper/observer team and to also act as a distraction for an assault team to gain entry into a location. Currently, the Toronto Police service does not their own helicopter, but has access to the helicopters from York and Durham Regional Police, along with the O.P.P and the R.C.M.P.

The unit also trains with members of the Canadian Military, in particular it's special forces / anti-terrorism unit [[Joint Task Force 2|Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2)]] which works out of the Dwyer Hill Training Facility outside of Ottawa.

The E.T.F. also has a close working relationship with other police tactical teams in the Greater Toronto Area, such as the York Regional Police Emergency Response Unit (E.R.U), the Durham Regional Police Tactical Support Unit (T.S.U) and the Peel Regional Police Tactical and Rescue Unit (T.R.U). 

==Equipment==
The E.T.F utilizes [[Glock]] 22 and 23 9mm pistols as their sidearm. Officers also have the [[Heckler &amp; Koch]] [[MP5-A3]] 9mm submachine gun, [[Remington 700]] bolt-action sniper rifle, Remington 870 shotgun, Mossberg M500 and the [[Colt]] [[M4 Carbine]] series of rifles, the Canadian name for it, [[Diemaco]] [[C8]] carbine ; [[Barrett M82A1]]. Less than lethal options are also at the disposal of team members such as the M18 and X26 Tasers, Pepper Spray (OC Spray) and Tear Gas (CS Gas) and Rubber Bullets or BeanBags rounds. 

The main vehicles used by the team include Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors and G.M.C Surburbans. The E.T.F also has an armoured car in their garage which can be used to rescue injured civlians or officers. The current armoured car was put into service about a year and half ago (January 2007).

Some police tactical teams have a police helicopter at their disposal. The helicopter can be used as a method of inserting team members, gathering valuable intelligence, acting as a position for a sniper/observer team and to also act as a distraction for an assault team to gain entry into a location. Currently, the Toronto Police service does not their own helicopter, but has access to the helicopters from York and Durham Regional Police, along with the O.P.P and the R.C.M.P.

Less than lethal options are also at the disposal of team members such as the M18 and X26 Tasers, Pepper Spray (OC Spray) and Tear Gas (CS Gas) and Rubber Bullets or BeanBags rounds. 

The main vehicles used by the team include Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors and G.M.C Surburbans. The E.T.F also has an armoured car in their garage which can be used to rescue injured civlians or officers. The current armoured car was put into service about a year and half ago (January 2007).

Some police tactical teams have a police helicopter at their disposal. The helicopter can be used as a method of inserting team members, gathering valuable intelligence, acting as a position for a sniper/observer team and to also act as a distraction for an assault team to gain entry into a location. Currently, the Toronto Police service does not their own helicopter, but has access to the helicopters from York and Durham Regional Police, along with the O.P.P and the R.C.M.P.

The '''Emergency Task Force''' '''(ETF)''' is a tactical unit of the [[Toronto Police Service]] to deal with high risk situations like gun calls, hostage taking, barricaded persons, emotionally disturbed persons, high risk arrest and protection details. The unit was created in [[1965]].

==Organization==
The unit's current commander is Staff Inspector James Ramer. Emergency Task Force currently comprises 70 officers from all units and are trained on tactical training. There are ten officers to each tactical team. Each tactical team has a team leader, sniper, negotiator / emotionally disturbed persons expert. All team members are also considered assaulters, who are trained to go into a premise and rescue any hostage(s) and arrest or neutralize any suspect(s)

The unit is located in [[Don Mills, Ontario]] at 35,000 square foot building built in [[1989]]:

* meeting rooms
* two shooting ranges
* rappelling tower
* exercise room 
* large garage to house the units specialized vehicles

The Emergency Task Force (E.T.F) is the unit which three of the police services specialized units fall into. The special weapons teams (tactical), [[explosive disposal unit]] (EDU), and the emergency response unit (ERU) which provides specialized equipment to the service (high powered lights, crane, mobile command post).

The team does training not only at their station in Don Mills, but also at [CFB Borden], a military base about 45 minutes north of the city. The unit also trains with members of the Canadian Military, in particular its special forces / anti-terrorism unit [[Joint Task Force 2|Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2)]] which works out of the [[Dwyer Hill Training Facility]] outside of Ottawa.

The E.T.F. also has a close working relationship with other police tactical teams in the Greater Toronto Area, such as the York Regional Police Emergency Response Unit (E.R.U), the Durham Regional Police Tactical Support Unit (T.S.U) and the Peel Regional Police Tactical and Rescue Unit (T.R.U).

==Equipment==
The E.T.F utilizes [[Glock]] 22 and 23 9mm pistols as their sidearm. Officers also have the [[Heckler &amp; Koch]] [[MP5-A3]] 9mm submachine gun, [[Remington 700]] bolt-action sniper rifle, Remington 870 shotgun, Mossberg M500 and the [[Diemaco]] [[C8]] carbine . Less than lethal options are also at the disposal of team members such as the M18 and X26 Tasers, Pepper Spray (OC Spray) and Tear Gas (CS Gas) and Rubber Bullets or BeanBags rounds. 

The main vehicles used by the team include Ford Crown Victoria Police Interceptors and G.M.C Surburbans. The E.T.F also has an armoured car in their garage which can be used to rescue injured civlians or officers. The current armoured car was put into service about a year and half ago (January 2007).

Some police tactical teams have a police helicopter at their disposal. The helicopter can be used as a method of inserting team members, gathering valuable intelligence, acting as a position for a sniper/observer team and to also act as a distraction for an assault team to gain entry into a location. Currently, the Toronto Police service does not their own helicopter, but has access to the helicopters from York and Durham Regional Police, along with the O.P.P and the R.C.M.P.
